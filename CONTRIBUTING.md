# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Actuali.

## Building

- Xcode with the iOS 26.1+ SDK
- Open `Actuali/Actuali.xcodeproj`; Swift Package Manager resolves dependencies on first build

```bash
xcodebuild -project Actuali/Actuali.xcodeproj -scheme Actuali -sdk iphonesimulator build
```

## Tests

```bash
xcodebuild -project Actuali/Actuali.xcodeproj -scheme Actuali \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=<any installed simulator>' test
```

The sync engine tests (`Actuali/ActualiTests/Services/Sync/SyncEngineFixtureTests.swift` and friends) verify CRDT behavior against fixtures derived from upstream Actual Budget — please keep them passing.

## UI tests

- New views must set `.accessibilityIdentifier()` on the elements UI tests attach to (buttons, text fields, rows, key containers), using a stable, feature-scoped name such as `categoryEditor.name` or `transactionRow.<id>`. UI tests target these identifiers instead of localized labels, which change with copy and locale.
- Identifiers are not user-facing: keep them out of the String Catalogs.

## Localization

All user-facing text must use the appropriate String Catalog through `String(localized:)` or a localized SwiftUI initializer. Do not add hard-coded English text to views, accessibility labels, errors, notifications, AppIntents, or services. Main app strings go in `Actuali/Actuali/Localizable.xcstrings`, App Shortcut phrases in `Actuali/Actuali/AppShortcuts.xcstrings`, and widget strings in `Actuali/ActualiWidgets/Localizable.xcstrings`.

When adding a catalog key, add all seven supported locale values, preserve every format placeholder, and run `python3 dev/scripts/validate-localization.py`. For a new language, update the Xcode project regions and the validator's supported locale list together.

## Issues

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome — please open a GitHub issue.

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused; one concern per PR
- Make sure the project builds and tests pass before opening a PR
- For sync-engine changes, reference the corresponding upstream behavior (`packages/crdt` / `packages/loot-core` in [actualbudget/actual](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual)) so it can be verified
- Don't bump the build number; that happens at release time
